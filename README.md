## :bulb: [What is GitHub Pages?](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)

> GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. 
> You can see examples of GitHub Pages sites in the [GitHub Pages examples collection](https://github.com/collections/github-pages-examples).

> There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. 
> Project sites are connected to a specific project hosted on GitHub, such as a JavaScript library or a recipe collection. User and organization sites are connected to a specific GitHub account.

In this demo, we will create a GitHub Pages site connected to a repository.
